# Last Updates

I changed the jekyll configuration and theme to something more usable for this purpose instead of the other one. Not a big deal.

I'm also now pushing this site to AWS S3 via `s3_website` and making some adjustments on the permissions as I find them being off. Everything should be copacetic.
