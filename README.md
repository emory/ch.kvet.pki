# README STUFF

This repository is the jekyll website project for the [Eyrie PKI](https://pki.kvet.ch/), a wee certificate authority for my household and projects. You can visit the site to get certificates you would want to install in order to use encrypted or validate signed email from us, or to know that a service you're using is actually maintained and bro^H^H^Hadministered by myself.

There are many reasons that I don't see much point in using one of the certificate authorities like Comodo for something like this, and you can read more about it on my [homepage](https://incumbent.org/about) if you care.

Anyway, this website gets shoveled to Amazon S3 and is served there. Certs and stuff are published there or in this repo at least for the foresable future.

## Theme

I used the thinkspace theme for this website, and the original README is below.jYou may assume a license inheritance for the website code.
